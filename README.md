# hardhat_SmartContract_Raffle (decentralised lottery application) :
Decentralized lottery smart contracts are a new way to play the lottery that are built on blockchain technology. They are more transparent, immutable, and decentralized than traditional lottery systems, making them a more fair and secure way to play. To participate, you simply send an entry fee to the smart contract and the winner is randomly selected. All contract funds are sent to the winner, and the lottery is then reset.
